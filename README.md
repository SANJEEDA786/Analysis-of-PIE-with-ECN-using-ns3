# Analysis-of-PIE-with-ECN-using-ns3
CN Course Project 

### Brief
PIE algorithm is defined in RFC 8033 where guidelines are provided to use ECN with
PIE. However, a thorough analysis of PIE with ECN is not done yet and would be interesting
to do. This project aims to understand the performance gain obtained by using ECN with PIE.
Required experience: Knowledge of PIE and ECN
Bonus experience: Knowledge of ns-3 is a plus.
Difficulty: Low to Moderate

# Analysis-of-PIE-with-ECN-using-ns3
CN Course Project 

### Brief
PIE algorithm is defined in RFC 8033 where guidelines are provided to use ECN with
PIE. However, a thorough analysis of PIE with ECN is not done yet and would be interesting
to do. This project aims to understand the performance gain obtained by using ECN with PIE.<br>
Required experience: Knowledge of PIE and ECN<br>
Bonus experience: Knowledge of ns-3 is a plus.<br>
Difficulty: Low to Moderate<br>
Recommended Reading:

Scheme to Address the Bufferbloat Problem (Link: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8033)
